This repo is to learn and share about low level Design patterns in java
1. Creational Design pattern: this design focuses on object creation, they help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented.
 1. Factory Pattern: In factory pattern, instead of creating objects in all different files, all the objects are created in one file so as if there is a logic change for the object creation, we just have to change one file.
